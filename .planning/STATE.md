# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Accurately detect chord changes from an MP3 and align them to the right positions in user-provided lyrics, producing a readable chord chart.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Project Scaffold

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Project Scaffold)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Pipeline-first order mandated — audio pipeline must produce correct chord data before any UI work begins
- Roadmap: Beat-synchronized template matching with Viterbi smoothing required (raw chroma argmax produces unusable output)
- Roadmap: FastAPI threadpool (run_in_executor) required for async audio processing — synchronous handling hangs the server

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: 7th chord template detection accuracy has no published baseline — validate empirically before committing to chord vocabulary
- Phase 4: Laplacian segmentation k-parameter needs tuning per song type — allow section label editing in UI from the start
- Phase 8: svguitar chord coverage for edge-case chord names (Ebm, F#7) must be tested early; confirm fallback behavior
